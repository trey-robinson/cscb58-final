Game doesn't work.
Reused old VGA adapter module code from Lab 6.

We were supposed to recreate the T-Rex Runner game from Google Chrome.

It was to consist of two elements: the character and the obstacles.
The character was to be a single box on the screen.
KEY[0] was supposed to be the button to make the character jump up to a certain height, after which it would fall down
at the same rate it had ascended. The character's X position would not change at all during the game.

The obstacles were supposed to be columns of pixels of varying height that the character would have to avoid. If the character
touched the obstacle, the game would reset.
